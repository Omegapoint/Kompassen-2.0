#   (max 70 chars/line)
#
#   Links or keys to relevant tickets (optional)
# </EXAMPLE>
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# <tag> can be:
#       [feat]        (New feature)
#       [bugfix]      (A code change that fixes unintended behaviour)
#       [WIP]         (Work in progress, for intermediate commits to save your work)
#       [docs]        (A change to documentation)
#       [refactor]    (A code change that changes structure but not behaviour)
#       [update]      (A code change that changes behaviour)
#       [perf]        (A code change that improves performance)
#       [test]        (Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests)
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Remember to:
#   * Use the imperative, present tense: 'change' not 'changed'
#   * No dot (.) at the end
#   * Capitalize the subject line
#   * Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   * Use the body to explain what and why not how
